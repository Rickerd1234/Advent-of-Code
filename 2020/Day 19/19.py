    #   And rule 11 returns these:
    #   (42, 31), (42, 42, 31, 31), (42, 42, 42, 31, 31, 31), ...
    #
    # - The loopy part comes in the second half of the rules. That means
    #   [42] or [42, 31] are already resolved when it is reached.
    #
    # - In the test rules and challenge rules rule 0 points directly
    #   to 8 and 11 IN THIS ORDER. That means every valid rule must follow
    #   one of these patterns:
    #   1. left + left:   42, 42, 31
    #   2. left + right:  42, x * 42, x * 31
    #   3. right + left:  x * 42, 42, 31
    #   4. right + right: x * 42, y * 42, y * 31
    #   They have in common that the left part is all 42, the right part
    #   is all 31 and the number of 31 is less than the number of 42.
    #
    # - Remember: Solve the challenge for the rules given, not any
    #   general rules! Start by resolving only rules 31 and 42.
    #   Then check the patterns.
    #
    # - Complication: 42 and 31 have many possibilities.
    #   But: both are always 5 characters long. I can split each message
    #   into 5-character words.
